## About 

HiÔºÅI'm Jie Xing.
Currently I‚Äôm a junior student majoring in Information and Computing Science ([_ICS_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_and_computer_science)) at Shanghai University ([_SHU_](https://en.shu.edu.cn/)) <!--as well as minoring in Wise Information Technology of Medical in [Shanghai Jiao Tong University(SJTU)](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/),--> expected to graduate in 2024. 

My research interests focus on statistics and optimization theory, reinforcement learning, medical imaging, robotics and their intersections. My QQ_number is 1906736267 and feel free to contact me. I'd like to communicate with anybody around me.

[\\]:(2022_11_16)

I love my major, which is about _**[Informatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informatics)**_ and **_[Computational Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_mathematics)_**
under the [Department of Mathematics](https://en.math.shu.edu.cn/) in SHU. I like working with data and collecting all kinds of information from different fields. So my friends often ask me for advice when it is difficulty to make a decision.
Despite all this, the more I know, the more I feel my ignorance.

Currently, I am looking for overlapping interests between **_Biomedical Engineering_** and **_Information Technology_**,
especially with the help of **Machine Learning**, and trying to find a balance between theoretical and applied research
in the following areas:

- AI + X
- Data Science
- Computational Social Science
- Bioinformatics and Healthcare


It is my duty to use information technology to provide convenience for human beings
although my academic performance is not very outstanding. I enjoy this process helping
others out of confusion to find a better self.
